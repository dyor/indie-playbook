name: setup-firebase
description: Create a Firebase project, register the Android + iOS apps, place google-services.json / GoogleService-Info.plist, and enable anonymous auth. Use when connecting the app to Firebase for the first time, or when the developer asks to set up Firebase / add the config files.

# Set up Firebase

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **⚠️ Critical SDK Version & KMP WASM Limitation**
> - **Gitlive Version**: Always use **at least version `2.5.0`** of the Gitlive Firebase Kotlin SDK. The latest stable version can be found at [GitLiveApp/firebase-kotlin-sdk](https://github.com/GitLiveApp/firebase-kotlin-sdk).
> - **WASM Technical Limitation**: Gitlive Firebase does **not** support Kotlin/WASM (`wasmJs` target). If your project contains a WASM target, the WASM target **must** be dropped once Firestore/Firebase is added, as the Gitlive libraries will cause compilation failures on WASM.

Firebase is the backend for auth, push notifications, and the AI Cloud Functions proxy. This skill
covers the base project + app registration + anonymous auth. Social sign-in is a separate step —
see `enable-auth`. The Cloud Functions deploy is `integrate-web-proxy`.

Most of this happens in the browser at https://console.firebase.google.com/ — you (the agent) can
prep identifiers and the SHA-1, but the developer performs the console clicks and file downloads.

## 1. Prep the identifiers — Agent Action

- **Android package** = the app's `applicationId` (in `MobileApp/androidApp/build.gradle.kts`).
- **iOS bundle id** = `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` in `MobileApp/iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.
- **Debug SHA-1** (required for Google sign-in on Android) — from `MobileApp/`:

  ```bash
  ./gradlew :androidApp:signingReport
  ```

  Copy the `SHA1` line under the `debug` variant for the developer to paste into Firebase.

## 2. Create the project — User Action

1. Open https://console.firebase.google.com/ → **Add project**, give it a name + unique project ID.
2. **Upgrade to the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan** — Project Overview → Usage and billing → Details &
   settings → Modify plan → **Blaze**. Required for Cloud Functions (`integrate-web-proxy`);
   generous free tier, set a budget alert.

## 3. Register the Android app + place config — User Action

1. In the project, **Add app → Android**.
2. **Package name** = the `applicationId` from step 1.
3. Paste the **debug SHA-1** from step 1 (needed for Google sign-in).
4. Download `google-services.json` and place it at:

   ```
   MobileApp/androidApp/google-services.json
   ```

## 4. Register the iOS app + place config — User Action

1. **Add app → iOS**.
2. **Bundle ID** = the iOS bundle id from step 1.
3. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it at:

   ```
   MobileApp/iosApp/iosApp/GoogleService-Info.plist
   ```

## 5. Enable Anonymous auth — User Action

Firebase Console → **Authentication → Sign-in method → Anonymous → Enable**. The app auto-signs in
anonymously on first launch (`signInAnonymouslyIfNecessary()`), and the Cloud Functions gate on a
Firebase ID token, so this is required even before social sign-in.

## 6. Set the default resource location — User Action

Firebase Console → **Storage → Get Started** → accept rules → pick a region.

> **This is not an app feature** — the app doesn't use Cloud Storage. It's a one-time
> Cloud Functions *deploy* prerequisite: `firebase deploy --only functions` uploads its source
> bundle to a GCS staging bucket, and a brand-new project that has never opened Storage/Firestore
> has no default resource location set, so that bucket can't be created — the first deploy
> (`integrate-web-proxy`) then fails with `Failed to make request to generateUploadUrl`. Clicking
> **Storage → Get Started** is just the simplest way to set the default location and avoid that.
> The region is **permanent** — pick the one closest to your users. Skip this if you're not
> deploying the Cloud Functions backend.

## 7. Validate — Validation

With the real `google-services.json` in place, from `MobileApp/`:

```bash
./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug
```

Run the app; the first launch should silently obtain an anonymous session.

## Next

- Enable Google/Apple sign-in → `enable-auth`.
- Deploy the AI backend and wire live calls → `integrate-web-proxy`.
- Whole phase orchestration → the `integrations` guide.
