# Features — <App name>

> [!NOTE]
> **Setup:** the `build-features` skill copies this template to the repository root as
> **`PROGRESS_FEATURES.md`** and keeps it up to date. It is the record of **what has actually been
> built** from the PRD — the phase files (`PROGRESS_P1…`) track the *guide's* steps; this one tracks
> *your app's features*.
>
> **Resume rule:** before building anything, read this file and continue from the first unchecked
> item. Never redo a checked item, and never re-derive the plan while unchecked items remain.
>
> **Commit it.** It travels with the repo so any session/machine can pick up where the last one stopped.

**Source of truth:** `AiGuidelines/project/prd.md` · `user_flow.md` · `ui_ux.md`
**Status key:** `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done
