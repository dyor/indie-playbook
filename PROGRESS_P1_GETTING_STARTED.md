## A. Prerequisites & first run
- [x] **User** — Install JDK 17+ and Android Studio (Android SDK). macOS/iOS: install Xcode.
- [x] **Agent** — `sdk.dir=` set in `MobileApp/local.properties` (`run-the-app` skill).
- [x] **User** — Run the app (`./gradlew :desktopApp:run`, or Android/Web) from `MobileApp/`.
- [x] **Validation** — App launches and shows the Home screen on at least one platform.

## B. Rebrand
- [x] **Agent** — Rename package/appId/bundle/name (`refactor-package` skill).
- [x] **Validation** — App still builds after the rename.

## C. Define the product
- [x] **Agent** — Product defined by the `new-app` skill: `prd.md`, `user_flow.md`, `ui_ux.md` filled + confirmed.
- [x] **Agent** — App name/id decided; deferred decisions marked `TODO(<phase>)` in `root/AppConfiguration.kt`.

## D. Build your features — `build-features`
> Per-feature status lives in **`PROGRESS_FEATURES.md`** (repo root), not here. This is just the gate.
- [x] **Agent** — Plan derived from `prd.md`/`user_flow.md`, confirmed, and written to `PROGRESS_FEATURES.md`.
- [x] **Agent** — Every model + screen in `PROGRESS_FEATURES.md` is checked off.
- [x] **Agent** — Shipped onboarding + paywall screens branded to this product.

## E. Validate
- [x] **Agent** — Run quality gates (`run-quality-gates` skill).
- [x] **User** — Re-run the app; confirm your features work on a device.

## Gate
- [x] App launches on at least one platform and shows the Home screen; quality gates pass.

Next: the `integrations` guide (Firebase, auth, backend), then `publishing`.
