/**
 * OPFS (Origin Private File System) persistence for the web [FileManagerImpl]'s bytes, so generated /
 * saved images survive a page reload or a new tab — the in-memory map alone is session-scoped.
 *
 * Bytes cross the JS boundary as **base64 strings** (clean on both js and wasmJs; avoids typed-array
 * interop differences). Files live under a [dirName] OPFS subdirectory so they don't collide with the
 * SQLite database file at the OPFS root. [dirName] is passed in (not a literal in the JS) so it stays a
 * Kotlin constant — see `Constants.WEB_INTERNAL_FILES_DIR_NAME`. The only per-target difference is these
 * two functions (`@JsFun` on wasmJs, `js("…")` on js) — same split as `createSQLiteWorker()`.
